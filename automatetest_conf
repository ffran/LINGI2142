# Create a virtual network using network namespaces and veth pairs
# to connect them.
# Assuming $CONFIGDIR == "cfg":
# * Files in cfg/<Node name> will be overlaid over /etc, i.e. if a file with
# the same name exists in both directory, the one in cfg/<Node name> will
# be the one used.
# * If cfg/<Node name>_$BOOT (defaults to cfg/<Node name>_boot) exists and
# is executable, it will be executed when the node is created
# * If cfg/<Node name>_$STARTUP (defaults to cfg/<Node name>_start) exists and
# is executable, it will be executed when the whole network has started
#

# IMPORTANT NOTE: Node names MUST NOT exceed 9 characters.
# This is due to the limitation to 14 characters of interface names
